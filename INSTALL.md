# Installing the EnnoDB FastCGI service

The following will install all of the FastCGI services in this repository (prefix, ennodb, counter). If you only need to install of them, YMMV and you need to change the install rule in the Makefile.

The services are installed into /opt. If you prefer another location, like /usr/local, then you need to change the PREFIX variable in the Makefile.

This procedure assumes that you have a Debian-based system, and requires a working compiler and the libfcgi-dev package. If you are unsure that these are installed, run: 

	sudo apt-get install build-essential libfcgi-dev

## download and build the source

First, clone the git repository:

	git clone https://github.com/badgerman/fastcgi.git
	cd fastcgi
	git submodule update --init

Now, build and install the code:
	make
	make test
	make install

The install procedure will ask you for your sudo password, because it copies files into locations that require administrative permission.

## Start the services, add them to nginx

The services are installed in /etc/init.d, so they are easy to start:
	
	sudo service ennodb start

Next, we need to tell nginx about the service. If you want ennodb to be available as http://your.host.name/api/ennodb.cgi/ then there is a configuration file (fastcgi.conf) for that, which was part of the installation process above. In your /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file, add one line inside the `server { [...] }` definition:
	
	include /etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf

Now just run `sudo service nginx reload` to activate your change, and try it!

    # store a value for key "foo":
    curl --data "Hello World" http://localhost/api/ennodb.cgi/foo
    # retrieve the value for key "foo":
    curl http://localhost/api/ennodb.cgi/foo

If this prints "Hello World", then you've done it. Alternatively, open http://your.host.name/keyval.html in your browser and fiddle around with it.
